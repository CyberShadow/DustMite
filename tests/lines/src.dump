    [ "\n  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister\non the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had\npeeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no\npictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'\nthought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,\nfor the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether\nthe pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble\nof getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White\nRabbit with pink eyes ran close by her." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice\nthink it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to\nitself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought\nit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\nbut when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\ntake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\ndown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge."

    [ "\n  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found herself\nfalling down a very deep well." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she\nhad plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to\nwonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look\ndown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\nsee anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\nnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\nhere and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She\ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was\nlabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\nsomebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\nfell past it." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\nshall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\nall think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\neven if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely\ntrue.)" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I\nwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.\n`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\nme see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\nyou see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her\nlessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good\nopportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to\nlisten to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,\nthat's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\nor Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\nor Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to\nsay.)" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\nTHROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the\npeople that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I\nthink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this\ntime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\nhave to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\nPlease, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\nto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\nthrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\nnever do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\nbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I\nshould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember\nher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were\ndown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\nyou might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\nBut do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\nrather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\nway, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do\nbats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\nquestion, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she\nwas walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very\nearnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a\nbat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\nsticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a\nmoment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her\nwas another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in\nsight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\naway went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\nsay, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\nit's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the\ncorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\nhanging from the roof." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\nother, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\nwondering how she was ever to get out again." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\nand Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\ndoors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\nthe key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\nthem.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\ncurtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\ndoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\nin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small\npassage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\nlooked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\nHow she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about\namong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\nshe could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if\nmy head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\nvery little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\nI could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\nknow how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\nhad happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\nthings indeed were really impossible." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\nwent back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\nit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\ntelescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\ncertainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\nof the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'\nbeautifully printed on it in large letters." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\nAlice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\nfirst,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not';\nfor she had read several nice little histories about children who\nhad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\nthings, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\ntheir friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\nwill burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\nnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\n`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\nlater." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\nto taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\nof mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\nturkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\nit off." "\n" ]

    [ "\n  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and\nher face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right\nsize for going through the little door into that lovely garden.\nFirst, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\ngoing to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about\nthis; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my\ngoing out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be\nlike then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is\nlike after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\never having seen such a thing." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided\non going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!\nwhen she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the\nlittle golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,\nshe found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it\nquite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb\nup one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\nand when she had tired herself out with trying,\nthe poor little thing sat down and cried." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to\nherself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'\nShe generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very\nseldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\nseverely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\ntrying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game\nof croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\nchild was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no\nuse now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,\nthere's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable\nperson!'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under\nthe table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on\nwhich the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\n`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,\nI can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep\nunder the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I\ndon't care which happens!'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which\nway?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to\nfeel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to\nfind that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally\nhappens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the\nway of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,\nthat it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the\ncommon way."

Oh! won't she\nbe savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate\nthat she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\ncame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,\nsir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid\ngloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard\nas he could go."

And yesterday\nthings went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in\nthe night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this\nmorning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little\ndifferent.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in\nthe world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'

Let me see:  four times five is twelve,\nand four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!\nI shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the\nMultiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.\nLondon is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,\nand Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been\nchanged for Mabel!

No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm\nMabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their\nheads down and saying \"Come up again, dear!\"  I shall only look\nup and say \"Who am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I\nlike being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down\nhere till I'm somebody else\"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a\nsudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads\ndown!

    [ "\n  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was\nsurprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little\nwhite kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done\nthat?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up\nand went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,\nas nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,\nand was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the\ncause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it\nhastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether."

    [ "\n`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at\nthe sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in\nexistence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed\nback to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut\nagain, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as\nbefore, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,\n`for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare\nit's too bad, that it is!'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another\nmoment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  Her first\nidea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that\ncase I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had\nbeen to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general\nconclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find\na number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in\nthe sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and\nbehind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that\nshe was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine\nfeet high." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,\ntrying to find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I\nsuppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer\nthing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a\nlittle way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at\nfirst she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then\nshe remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that\nit was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this\nmouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should\nthink very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in\ntrying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of\nthis pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'\n(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:\nshe had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having\nseen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a\nmouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little\neyes, but it said nothing." "\n" ]

(For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had\nno very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she\nbegan again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in\nher French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the\nwater, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg\nyour pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the\npoor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'" "\n" ]

And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:\nI think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.\nShe is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,\nas she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so\nnicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and\nshe is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital\none for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,\nfor this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt\ncertain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any\nmore if you'd rather not.'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end\nof his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our family\nalways HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear\nthe name again!'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the\nsubject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'\nThe Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is\nsuch a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!\nA little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly\nbrown hair!  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and\nit'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I\ncan't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you\nknow, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!\nHe says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a\nsorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the\nMouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and\nmaking quite a commotion in the pool as it went." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back\nagain, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't\nlike them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam\nslowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice\nthought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to\nthe shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll\nunderstand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'"

There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'\nbut nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  `I know\nSOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,\n`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this\nbottle does.  I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for\nreally I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'" "\n" ]

    [ "\n  Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and\ngrowing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in\nanother minute there was not even room for this, and she tried\nthe effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the\nother arm curled round her head.  Still she went on growing, and,\nas a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one\nfoot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,\nwhatever happens.  What WILL become of me?'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full\neffect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable,\nand, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting\nout of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one\nwasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about\nby mice and rabbits.  I almost wish I hadn't gone down that\nrabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,\nthis sort of life!  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!\nWhen I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing\nnever happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!  There\nought to be a book written about me, that there ought!  And when\nI grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a\nsorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more\nHERE.'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I\nam now?  That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--\nbut then--always to have lessons to learn!  Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'" "\n" ]

    [ "\n  `Mary Ann!  Mary Ann!' said the voice.  `Fetch me my gloves\nthis moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on the\nstairs.  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and\nshe trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she\nwas now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no\nreason to be afraid of it."

    [ "\n  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;\nbut, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed\nhard against it, that attempt proved a failure.  Alice heard it\nsay to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she\nfancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly\nspread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.  She did not\nget hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,\nand a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was\njust possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something\nof the sort." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are\nyou?'  And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then\nI'm here!  Digging for apples, yer honour!'" "\n" ]

    [ "\n  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear\nwhispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer\nhonour, at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at\nlast she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in\nthe air.  This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more\nsounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames there\nmust be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for\npulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I\ndon't want to stay in here any longer!'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  at\nlast came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a\ngood many voices all talking together:  she made out the words:\n`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;\nBill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up\nat this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half\nhigh enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--\nHere, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind\nthat loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!  Heads below!' (a loud\ncrash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go\ndown the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,\nthen!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to\ngo down the chimney!'" "\n" ]

    [ "\n  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and\nwaited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what\nsort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close\nabove her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one\nsharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes\nBill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the\nhedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold\nup his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?\nWhat happened to you?  Tell us all about it!'" "\n" ]

    [ "\n  `So you did, old fellow!' said the others." "\n" ]

    [ "\n  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to\nherself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any\nsense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they\nbegan moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A\nbarrowful will do, to begin with.'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to\ndoubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came\nrattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.\n`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,\n`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead\nsilence." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all\nturning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright\nidea came into her head.  `If I eat one of these cakes,' she\nthought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it\ncan't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I\nsuppose.'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find\nthat she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small\nenough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and\nfound quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.\nThe poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by\ntwo guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.\nThey all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she\nran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a\nthick wood." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she\nwandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;\nand the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.\nI think that will be the best plan.'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and\nsimply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the\nsmallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering\nabout anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over\nher head made her look up in a great hurry." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round\neyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.\n`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried\nhard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the\ntime at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it\nwould be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of\nstick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped\ninto the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,\nand rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice\ndodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run\nover; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy\nmade another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in\nits hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very\nlike having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle\nagain; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the\nstick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long\nway back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat\ndown a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its\nmouth, and its great eyes half shut." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;\nso she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out\nof breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the\ndistance." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she\nleant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself\nwith one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks\nvery much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!  Oh\ndear!  I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!  Let\nme see--how IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or\ndrink something or other; but the great question is, what?'" "\n" ]
    [ "\n  The great question certainly was, what?  Alice looked all round\nher at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see\nanything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under\nthe circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her,\nabout the same height as herself; and when she had looked under\nit, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her\nthat she might as well look and see what was on the top of it."

    [ "\n  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the\ntiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes\nwere looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her\nvoice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back\nthe wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and\nstill as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place\naround her became alive the strange creatures of her little\nsister's dream." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried\nby--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the\nneighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as\nthe March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,\nand the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate\nguests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the\nDuchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once\nmore the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's\nslate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable\nMock Turtle." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and\nall would change to dull reality--the grass would be only\nrustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the\nreeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-\nbells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd\nboy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and\nall thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the\nconfused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the\ncattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's\nheavy sobs." "\n" ]
    [ "\n  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of\nhers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how\nshe would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and\nloving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about\nher other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager\nwith many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of\nWonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their\nsimple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\nremembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days."
